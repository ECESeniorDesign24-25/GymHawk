## GymHawk

This repository stores the firmware and other miscellaneous items for the GymHawk system

#### IoT Cloud
All devices are connected to the Arduino IoT Cloud. To set it up, you must add the device to GymHawk "Thing" in Arduino IoT Cloud. Then you can flash the sketch stored on the cloud. 

#### Firmware
For the firmware running on the Arduino will be written on the Arduino IoT Cloud platform, but I figured it would be good to track it here too. A lot of the file gets autogenerated to connect to WiFi and the cloud. WIP
