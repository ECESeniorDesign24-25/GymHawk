These are some scripts I have been using to test comms and flashing from my computer. Check the comments to update the locations and names to whatever your computer uses.

`flash.sh`: flashes the arduino with a binary file. youll need to update a bunch of variables in the file

`test_com.sh`: tests that the arduino is correctly configured (will say port busy if running code)

`serial.sh`: opens a screen with serial output
